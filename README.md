# 🛫 Tourism in the Canary Islands - Part I: A booming industry.
Hello! 

Welcome to this repository where I start exploring the largest industry in the Canary Islands. In this first part I go through some of the key indicators that paint a picture of the current state of the sector. How many tourists visit the islands each year? Where do they come from? What are the most popular destinations?

From there, it’s time to start looking at the economy behind it. How much money do tourists spend during their stay? How much income does the tourist sector generate? How have these figures evolved over time? Can we spot any differences between the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods?

## 🔎 Dive deeper.
This repository contains the scripts used for the analysis, along with a Quarto file that walks through the data fetching and cleaning steps, followed by data visualisation and some key insights. If you are curious and want to know more about the state of tourism in the Canary Islands, feel free to explore the [blog post](https://www.oliverqr.com/blog/tourism_canary_islands_part_I) where I go through all of this. It sets the stage for Part II (coming soon), where I’ll dive into the socioeconomic impact tourism has on life in the islands and why many believe it’s time for change. Stay tuned!
