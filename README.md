# 🛫 Tourism in the Canary Islands: A booming industry where locals struggle.
Hello! 

Welcome to this data analysis project where I explore the tourism sector and its impact on the Canary Islands. In [part I](https://www.oliverqr.com/blog/tourism_canary_islands_part_1), I examine key indicators that paint a picture of the current state of the sector. In [part II](https://www.oliverqr.com/blog/tourism_canary_islands_part_2), I begin to explore the impact tourism has in the living conditions of the local population.

## 🔎 Dive deeper.
How many tourists arrive each year? Which are the most popular islands? How much revenue is generated? How does all this translate into the everyday live of locals? These – and other –questions are addressed in this project. 

This repository contains the R scripts I used to fetch, clean, and analyse the data, while the main conclusions can be read on the following blog posts: [part I](https://www.oliverqr.com/blog/tourism_canary_islands_part_1) and [part II](https://www.oliverqr.com/blog/tourism_canary_islands_part_2).

And this is not the end – part III is on the way. Stay tuned!
